After a period of hard work, we have completed and officially launched a new version of RequestBin called Next-Gen RequestBin. Now, let's take a look at the 3 main features in this version.

# 1. Support both DNS and HTTP on an unique ID
In this version, we have combined DNSBin and RequestBin into a single function. A subdomain is provided to you that will collect requests made to it and let you inspect them in a human-friendly way in both of DNS and HTTP protocol.
